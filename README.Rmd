# Readme

This file is a test project for using github actions within an R-Project.

So far, there is a setup.R script where I used the usethis package to create a github repo, a folder for my github actions, a testthat folder for my tests.

There are two scripts with simple functions in them: addition.R and setup.R.

In the tests folder, theres a folder with two testscripts, testing the two functions from addition.R and multiplication.R

The testthat.R specifies the directory with tests and is called within my workflow everytime I push or there is a pull request.

All github actions workflows are in ./github/workflows
